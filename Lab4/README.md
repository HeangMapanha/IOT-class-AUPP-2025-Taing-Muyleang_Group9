## 1. Overview

This project demonstrates a complete IoT pipeline using ESP32, MQTT, Node-RED, InfluxDB, and Grafana. The ESP32 runs MicroPython and sends simulated sensor data (random integers) to an MQTT broker. Node-RED subscribes to the MQTT topic, processes the data, and writes it to InfluxDB, a time-series database. Grafana is then used to visualize the data in a real-time dashboard.

## 2. Learning Income

By completing this project, you will learn:
- How to connect an ESP32 to Wi-Fi and publish MQTT messages using MicroPython.
- Setting up Node-RED flows to receive MQTT data and write it into InfluxDB.
- Creating and querying a time-series database using InfluxDB 1.x (InfluxQL).
- Visualizing real-time data in Grafana dashboards.
- Integrating multiple IoT tools to create a fully functional pipeline.
- Troubleshooting network, MQTT, database, and visualization issues.
