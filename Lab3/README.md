# 1. Overview

The BMP280 sensor provides reliable and high-resolution data while consuming minimal power.
It communicates via I²C or SPI, allowing easy integration with microcontrollers such as ESP32, ESP8266, and Arduino.

# 2. Learning Income

- Interface BMP280 sensor with ESP32 using MicroPython.
- Read and process temperature, pressure, and altitude data.
- Connect ESP32 to MQTT brokers and publish telemetry data.
- Visualize sensor data on ThingsBoard Cloud dashboards.
- Gain hands-on experience in IoT hardware, firmware, and cloud integration.

# 3. Equipments

Hardware:
- ESP32 or ESP8266 microcontroller
- BMP280 sensor module
- Jumper wires
  
Software:
- Thonny IDE
- MicroPython firmware installed on ESP32
- bmp280.py driver uploaded to the board (You can find the library in the Lab3 and save it in Micropython)
