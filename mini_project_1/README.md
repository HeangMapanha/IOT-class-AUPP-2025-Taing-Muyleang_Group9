# 1. Overview
Build a three-slot smart parking system using an ESP32 that:
• detects vehicles at the entry gate with an ultrasonic sensor,
• shows available slots on an LCD and opens the servo gate only if space is available,
• assigns auto-IDs 1–3 to cars in the order they actually occupy a slot (via IR sensors),
• records time-in and time-out automatically,
• calculates the parking fee,
• shows live status on a web dashboard hosted by the ESP32,
• and sends receipts to Telegram when cars leave.
