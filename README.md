# IOT-class-AUPP-2025-Taing-Muyleang_Group9

1. Overview

   In this lab, you will build a tiny IoT monitoring node with an ESP32, DHT22 temperature/humidity sensor, and a relay. The ESP32 sends Telegram        alerts when the temperature rises above a threshold and lets users control the relay via chat commands. Once the temperature drops below the          threshold again, the relay turns off automatically.
