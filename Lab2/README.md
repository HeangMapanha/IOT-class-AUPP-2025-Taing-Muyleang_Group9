# 1. Overview

In this lab, students will design an ESP32-based IoT system with MicroPython that integrates a
web interface and an LCD display. The system will allow users to control an LED, read sensors,
and send custom messages to the LCD through a webserver.
This lab emphasizes interaction between web UI and hardware, giving students practice in event-
driven IoT design.
