# 1. Overview

In this lab, students will design an ESP32-based IoT system with MicroPython that integrates a
web interface and an LCD display. The system will allow users to control an LED, read sensors,
and send custom messages to the LCD through a webserver.
This lab emphasizes interaction between web UI and hardware, giving students practice in event-
driven IoT design.

# 2. Learning Outcomes ( (CLO Alignment)
By the end of this lab, students will be able to:
- Implement a MicroPython webserver to serve HTML controls.
- Control an LED from the web page.
- Read data from DHT11 and ultrasonic sensors and expose it on the webserver.
- Use web buttons to selectively show temperature and distance on an LCD (IÂ²C).
- Send custom text from a textbox to display on the LCD.
- Document wiring, interface behavior, and system operation.
